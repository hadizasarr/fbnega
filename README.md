Goal: Background of FBNEGA and gain understanding of project. 
Organization purpose: Gather donated and purchased food from a variety of different sources to distribute amongst those individuals in need residing in their service region. 
Problem: FBNEGA needs to understand the change in distribution patterns over time, specifically the changes from the first half (FH) of 2024 to FH 2025, and among fiscal year (FY) 2023, 2024, and 2025, so that they can determine what volume of food they need to distribute among their service region. 

*** To run code: python3 [name of script] in src *** 

Questions to explore:
1) What are the distribution trends for each county?
a) Plot overall food distributed by month for each county.

b) Compare year-over-year distribution by month (e.g., January 2024 compared to January 2025) for each county.
c) Calculate all-time food distributed by county over each time period:
i) Compare FY 2023, 2024, and 2025 totals.
ii) Compare FH 2024 total to FH 2025 total.
2) Do a “deep dive” on each county where significant changes in output are noted, either year-over-year by month, or over FHs or FYs:
a) Was there a drastic change in distribution for a specific product category?
b) Was there a drastic change in distribution for a specific partner agency?
